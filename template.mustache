Dear {{ firstname }},

Here are your new passwords for the OBP email system, which is being
migrated to Fastmail this evening. It may be accessed via a webmail
system or via normal email clients such as Outlook, Thunderbird and 
so on.

There is a master password which you can use for the webmail system, which
also affords a rich system of options for customising your email, e.g.,
setting timezone, automatic filters, and so on. Secondarily, there is
an "IMAP password" which is used by apps (such as Outlook, etc) to
access email on your behalf. My earlier message omitted to mention
what this password was!

Login URL: https://www.fastmail.com/login/

Username: {{ username }}@openbookpublishers.com

Master Password: {{ password }}

IMAP Password (ignore spaces): {{ imap }}

The IMAP Password is randomly generated by the Fastmail system - you
can order it to generate you a new or additional one. Please change
the master password yourself to something you can easily
remember. Contemporary best practice is to use a longish phrase chosen
from random words, e.g.:

cherry-HUMBUG-clarification-9931r-doctrinal

I shall update the account settings on machines in the office. If you have
other email access methods (e.g., your phone), you may need the following
details, though of course I'll help migrate those too:

IMAP server: imap.openbookpublishers.com

Port: 993

SSL/TLS: yes

Yours,

Martin Keegan
